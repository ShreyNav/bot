# Serverless-AWS-Slack-Bot

## Overview
This project came from my wanting to learn the [serverless](https://www.serverless.com) toolkit and AWS Lambda & CloudFormation technologies.

Integrating with Slack, this is an easily-extensible python framework for controlling with AWS resources via Slack.

The entire stack is serverless and stateless. Use of SNS + lambda functions to dispatch long-running tasks means it should scale very well!

## Commands
Bot commands currently available:

* **@BotName ec2 create**
* **@BotName ec2 list**
* **@BotName ec2 terminate <instance-id>**
* **@BotName get budget**
* **@BotName toss coin**



## Installing

### Deployment via serverless

git clone the repo, edit serverless.yml to your specification && sls deploy


### Configuration

Everything is controlled via environment variables in the serverless.yml file.

Most of the options will be self-explanatory and are commented, however you will want to pay attention to the following:

**AUTHTOKEN** - must be set to your Slack Bot User OAuth Access Token

**KEYPAIR** - name of the AWS keypair to use for your EC2 instances

**SG** - name of the AWS security group to use



## Notes / TODO list
This was built assuming a trusted Slack environment. Minimal input validation is performed and the IAM policies should be tightend up for a production environment.
