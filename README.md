# Serverless-AWS-Slack-Bot

## Overview
This project came from my wanting to learn the serverless toolkit and AWS Lambda & CloudFormation technologies.

Integrating with Slack, this is an easily-extensible python framework for controlling with AWS resources via Slack.

The entire stack is serverless and stateless. Use of SNS + lambda functions to dispatch long-running tasks means it should scale very well!
